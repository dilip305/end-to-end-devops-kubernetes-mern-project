# end-to-end-devops-kubernetes-mern-project
Complete DevOps implementation on MERN stack using Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.


Project Overview:

IAM User Setup: Create an IAM user on AWS with the necessary permissions to facilitate deployment and management activities.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use Terraform and AWS CLI to set up the Jenkins server (EC2 instance) on AWS.
Jenkins Server Configuration: Install and configure essential tools on the Jenkins server, including Jenkins itself, Docker, Sonarqube, Terraform, Kubectl, AWS CLI, and Trivy.
EKS Cluster Deployment: Utilise eksctl commands to create an Amazon EKS cluster, a managed Kubernetes service on AWS.
Load Balancer Configuration: Configure AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the EKS cluster.
Amazon ECR Repositories: Create private repositories for both frontend and backend Docker images on Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
ArgoCD Installation: Install and set up ArgoCD for continuous delivery and GitOps.
Sonarqube Integration: Integrate Sonarqube for code quality analysis in the DevSecOps pipeline.
Jenkins Pipelines: Create Jenkins pipelines for deploying backend and frontend code to the EKS cluster.
Monitoring Setup: Implement monitoring for the EKS cluster using Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana.
ArgoCD Application Deployment: Use ArgoCD to deploy the Three-Tier application, including database, backend, frontend, and ingress components.
DNS Configuration: Configure DNS settings to make the application accessible via custom subdomains.
Data Persistence: Implement persistent volumes and persistent volume claims for database pods to ensure data persistence.
Conclusion and Monitoring: Conclude the project by summarising key achievements and monitoring the EKS cluster’s performance using Grafana.
